				<p>
					Ever needed to move a spawner? 
					Or maybe you just don't like NOT being able to harvest chiseled bookshelves without silk touch?<br />
					Don't worry! This plugin fixes both of your issues!
				</p>
				<p>
					To get a spawner, mine it with an iron pickaxe or higher. The pickaxe MUST have silk touch.<br />
					You also no longer need silk touch to make chiseled bookshelves drop themselves.
				</p>
				<p>
					All of the <a href="../apotheosis">modifications</a> you made to the spawner are saved.
