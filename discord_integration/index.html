					You know how Minecraft servers sometimes have corresponding Discord servers? Yeah...
				</p>
				<p class="page1 hidden">
					When enabled, the plugin will also act as a bot for the Discord server.
					The bot will synchronize the messages in a Discord channel with the Minecraft server's chat.
				</p>
				<p class="page2 hidden">
					The server may also decide to enforce a whitelist managed by the Discord server,
					 in which case, you will need to link your Discord account with your Minecraft username.<br />
					In order to do so, join both the Discord server and Minecraft server and use the Discord command 
					<span class="equation">/whitelist &lt;link code&gt;</span> with the link code provided by the Minecraft server.
				</p>
				<p class="page2 hidden">
					You may link multiple Minecraft accounts to one Discord account but not vice versa.<br />
					You may unlink a Minecraft account from a Discord account by either using the Discord command
					 <span class="equation">/unlink &lt;Minecraft username&gt;</span>
					 or the Minecraft command <span class="equation">/unlink</span>.<br />
					You may view a list of all linked accounts using the Discord command <span class="equation">/links</span>.
				</p>
				<p class="page3 hidden">
					If the server uses a Discord-managed whitelist, 
					all messages sent from the Discord channel synchronized to the Minecraft server's chat, 
					will be sent as that Discord account's primary Minecraft account.<br />
					In order to change which Minecraft account is your primary account, use the Discord command 
					<span class="equation">/setprimary &lt;Minecraft username&gt;</span>.
				</p>
				<p class="page3 hidden">
					You can also use <span class="equation">/sync</span> to update the data the server knows about you, 
					since it's not omniscient.
