				<p class="page1 hidden">
					Is your mind a single being? If so then get out of this page, 
					for this is only useful for players with plural systems!<br />
					(For the record, I am not a cop, I cannot prevent you from reading this page 
					if you are interested in its material, nor do I have any intention to)
				</p>
				<p class="page1 hidden">
					In order to use this feature, you need to mark your account 
					as a plural system using <span class="equation">/system enable</span>.<br />
					You can reverse the decision by using <span class="equation">/system disable</span>.<br />
					You can then also name your system using <span class="equation">/system name [name]</span> 
					and set the system's tag using <span class="equation">/system tag [tag]</span>.<br />
					In order to unset either of these two properties, use 
					<span class="equation">/system name</span> 
					and <span class="equation">/system tag</span> respectively.
				</p>
				<p class="page2 hidden">
					A plural system is no good without any members, so don't forget to create some with 
					<span class="equation">/member &lt;name&gt; create</span>!<br />
					You can view a list of all members of your plural system by using<br /> 
					<span class="equation">/member list</span>.
				</p>
				<p class="page2 hidden">
					You can delete already created members with <span class="equation">/member &lt;name&gt; delete</span>,
					but if you wish to rename the member instead, then you can use 
					<span class="equation">/member &lt;name&gt; rename &lt;new name&gt;</span>.
				</p>
				<p class="page2 hidden">
					Do you want to modify the member's <a href="../display_tags/">display tags</a>? 
					Well you can also do that with <span class="equation">/member &lt;name&gt; display</span>
					with the same syntax as the <span class="equation">/display</span> command.<br />
				</p>
				<p class="page3 hidden">
					In order to actually use the system for its intended purpose, 
					you need to set some proxy tags on your members.<br />
					Proxy tags are what you enclose your message in to tell the plugin 
					which member you want to proxy as.<br />
					Common proxy tags are <span class="equation">[square brackets]</span>, 
					<span class="equation">{curly brackets}</span> or <span class="equation">A:letter prefixes</span>.<br />
					And yes, I stole those examples from <a href="https://pluralkit.me/guide/#proxying">PluralKit</a>, 
					don't blame me.
				</p>
				<p class="page3 hidden">
					In order to set the proxy tags of a member, you need to use 
					<span class="equation">/member &lt;name&gt; proxy [tags]</span>.<br />
					The tags provided need to have <span class="equation">text</span> somewhere,
					which represents the message you are wrapping in the proxy tags.<br />
					You can leave out the tags parameter to clear the proxy tags of a member.
				</p>
				<p class="page4 hidden">
					You can also set a front for your system, which will automatically proxy 
					all your messages which don't trigger another proxy.<br />
					To do so, type in <span class="equation">/front &lt;name&gt;</span>.
					You can also do just <span class="equation">/front</span> to clear your front.<br />
					Mention that your front gets cleared when you leave.
				</p>
				<p class="page4 hidden">
					Also, you cannot use a proxy while using the Discord channel.<br />
					And any unproxied messages don't contain any evidence of you being a plural system.
				</p>
				<p class="page5 hidden">
					You can optionally set a skin for a member of your plural system.<br />
					To do that, you do <span class="equation">/member &lt;name&gt; skin [mineskin id]</span>.<br />
					The command requires a <a href="https://mineskin.org">Mineskin ID or URL</a>.<br />
					You can remove a member's skin by just doing <span class="equation">/member &lt;name&gt; skin</span>.
				</p>
				<p class="page5 hidden">
					A member's skin will replace your own while they are set as your front. 
					It will also appear in the <a href="../discord_integration/">linked Discord channel</a> 
					when sending messages, but not when obtaining advancements, joining, quitting or dying.
