			<b>Computers</b>, Let's start with the normal computers, they're basically
			turtles but worse since they can't move, break blocks, or fight. They can
			however execute any javascript code.

			<b>Monitor Computers</b>, Unlike many mods out there we don't have seperate
			monitors but our monitors are also computers, bascially monitor computers are
			computers but with an editable map infront, they can also execute javascript
			code just like normal computers.

			<b>Turtles</b>, Basically computers with wheels, they can execute javascript
			code but can also move, break blocks and pick up items making them useful for
			automated tasks such as mining or tree harvesting. They can also place
			blocks, so if you want an automated house build you can do that too.

		<p class="section">
			<b>Sword Turtles</b>, A different type of turtle that has a sword instead of
			a pickaxe, sacrifising the ability to break blocks with the ability to hit
			mobs and players. The great part is that unlike some other mods turtle kills
			count as player kills so you stilll get the correct mob loot.

		<p class="section">
			<b>Upgrades</b>, Specifically the turtle and sword turtle have upgrades. The
			general pattern is 4 diamonds in the corners the upgrade item in the middle
			and 4 of the same item in the last 4 slots. If an upgrade is only for a
			specific turtle itll be noted after the upgrade name on this page.

		<p class="section">
			<b>Speed Upgrade</b>, Makes every action the turtle does 10% faster, to craft
			this place 4 diamonds in the corners, sugar in the middle and redstone in the
			other 4 slots.
