			<b>Custom Enchanting Table</b>, We added a custom enchanting table so you
			could en chant your items with out custom enchants, to get it you just need
			to make an enchantmant altar instead of a standart enchanting layout. To make
			the altar build a 3x3 out of smooth quartz and place the enchanting table on
			top of the middle block, then add quartz stairs to all 4 sides, now for the
			corners place 3 obisidian pillars upward and then you can start enchanting.

			<b>Custom Enchanting</b>, To add a custom enchant to a tool or gear piece you
			need to throw 1 lapis, 1 xp bottle (craftable), and the item you want to
			enchant on the enchanting table. Do note however that enchants can fail, the
			only thing that happens is a sound effect and the lapis and xp diddspears,
			you don't lose the item. There are 2 ways an enchant can fail, 1 is losing
			the 50/50 when you throw the items on, the second is if there are no
			enchantments left for your tool.
