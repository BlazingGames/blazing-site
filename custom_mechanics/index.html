			<b>Craftable XP Bottles</b>, Partly because of the
			<a href="#enchants">custom enchants</a> and partly because it's just useful
			we added craftable xp bottles. To "craft" the xp bottles you click an empty
			bottle while you have levels, it drains 1 of your levels to get you an xp
			bottle.

			<b>Silk Touch Spawners</b>, Something that should be in vanilla anyways we added it. With the silk touch enchantment on a pickaxe of iron quality or higher you can break spawners and get them in your inventory, all the metadata stays so if you <a href="apotheosis">modified it</a> previously you don't need to again.
