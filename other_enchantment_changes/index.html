				Other Enchantment Related Changes

				<p>
					Some changes related to enchanting are too minor to receive their own page.<br />
					<s>And also since the enchantments section of this site is too cluttered already.</s><br />
					Here's all of those too minor changes:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Shift Right Click on a block with a <i class="mcitem glass_bottle"></i> to turn one into
						an <i class="mcitem experience_bottle"></i> at the cost of 1 level.
					</li>
					<li>
						Librarians will no longer sell enchanted books. Instead they will sell and buy other book and banner related items. 
						Master level Librarians may also sell <a href="../tomes">a new tome, the <i class="mcitem greed_tome"></i></a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						The level cost of using the <i class="mcitem anvil"></i> has been reduced and capped at 10 levels, 
						but you can no longer upgrade enchantment levels by providing two of the same enchantment with identical levels.
					</li>
				</ul>
